						<div class="heading2-text">Pandas are one of the most beloved and iconic animals in the world. They are
							native to China and are primarily found in
							the central highlands of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. Pandas are herbivorous and mainly eat
							bamboo, but they
							also consume other plant materials like fruits and vegetables. A typical day in the life of a panda
							revolves around
							eating and sleeping. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, which is their primary food source.
							They have a
							special digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from the tough bamboo leaves and stems.
							Despite this,
							pandas are still classified as carnivores because they have the digestive system of a meat-eating animal.
							When they're
							not eating, pandas spend a lot of time sleeping. They usually sleep for up to 12 hours a day,
